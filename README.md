# GPT - Basically: a weekend project that got really out of hand
## Inspired by [Robo-CJ at MIT](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/robo-cj-writes-a-college-app/ "The funniest thing I've ever read")
TBH, I don't even know where to start with this one. I made a copy of the code (available at [Google's collab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VLG8e7YSEwypxU-noRNhsv5dW4NfTGce "Click me!")) and just started plugging in a frick ton of data.

## The DATA
All I really had to do is download a BUNCH of my old writing (journal entries, short stories, longer stories, etc, etc) and convert them into .txt files. That was all fun and dandy, but I got bored with that because I've only done so much writing in the past (AKA a lot but when it comes to this, there isn't actually a lot to work with), so I started getting creative.

Other Data I Used:
* My text messages with my friend, Alison
* My college application essays (oh no)
* Troye Sivan songs

Pulling data actually took some time because I'm not actually too familiar with data mining. Text messages were the hardest to pull just because I couldn't access my message archives (curse my old computer), so I had to copy things directly into a PDF and read from there. Troye Sivan songs were also a (fun) challenge. I ended up just pulling data directly from links. Thank GOD a-z lyrics has consistent formatting.

## The (cursed) results
